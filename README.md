Pokemon Team Builder
====================

A Javascript team builder for the Pokemon X and Y games. Enter the Pokemon in your party and a table is populated with their weaknesses.

If you would like the team builder to suggest teammates after the table is generated, use the "Find Complimentary Teammates" button.

Weakness calculation and Pokemon listings are lifted from [Pokemon Showdown](http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/). You can view the Pokemon Showdown project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown).

This project also makes use of the [jQuery](jquery.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) libraries.
